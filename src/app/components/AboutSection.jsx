                    Hello, I'm Nendy, I am an Accounting graduate transitioning into a Front-End Engineer. I have previously completed RevoUâ€™s Full-Stack Engineer Bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience and skills. My recent work experience at Hijra Alami has allowed me to develop a versatile skill set, where I worked as a Freelance QA Automation Engineer ensuring a smooth transition for their core banking system, and then transitioned into a Front-End Engineer role in the finance and deposits division. In this role, I directly contributed to improving user experience and streamlining financial processes. I am proficient in front-end technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Playwright, and Tailwind CSS, and have an understanding of back-end technologies including Python, Poetry, Postman, and Flask. My combined experience in QA and Front-End Development, along with my ability to adapt quickly and contribute to critical projects, makes me a valuable asset to any team.
